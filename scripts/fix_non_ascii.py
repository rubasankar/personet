"""
Normalize "typographic artifact" characters that AI code-generation tools
tend to sprinkle into source files (smart quotes, em/en dashes, non-breaking
spaces, zero-width characters, etc.) back to their plain-ASCII equivalents.

This is intentionally NOT a blanket unidecode pass. Blanket transliteration
would also mangle *deliberate* non-ASCII content that legitimately belongs
in a Django project -- currency symbols (₹, €, £), translated strings in
.po files, accented names in fixtures/tests, emoji in comments, etc.

Instead, we only touch a curated set of characters that are near-universally
AI-formatting mistakes rather than intentional content, and that are also
the ones most likely to actually break code (e.g. a curly quote where a
real string quote was meant, or a non-breaking space that silently causes
an IndentationError/SyntaxError).

Usage (e.g. as a pre-commit hook):
    fix_non_ascii.py file1.py file2.js ...
Exit code is non-zero if any files were modified, so pre-commit will ask
you to re-stage.
